When to use bash academy and how to use it**

 Bash academy can be downloaded onto a local storage medium and can be accessed via a web browser. Alternatively, one can host  into onto a web server and make it available to other users eg. students.
	
 Bash academy can be used whilst using the bash shell to look up commands via the easy to navigate interface. For teaching or learning purposes one can work through the respective sections in the order they have been presented or jump to a specific section which one wants to learn. The section on bash games(which is still to be completed) will also be a valuable and effective tool for revising concepts and testing one's skills.

The platform that bash academy is built upon also allows content to be easily edited and extended so teachers can update content if they need to do so. If one is using it as a reference, extra notes, caveats and snippets can be added for easy access later one when the need might arise.
